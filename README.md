# Climate Change Analysis in Saudi Arabia

This research project analyzes climate change in Saudi Arabia using multiple datasets and machine learning models for prediction. The project is divided into two main parts: data analysis and machine learning.

## Data Analysis

The data analysis part of the project involves the following steps:

1. Data collection: Ww collected multiple datasets related to climate change in Saudi Arabia, including data on temperature, humidity, and CO2 emmisions.

2. Data cleaning and preprocessing: cleaned and preprocessed the datasets to remove any missing data, outliers, or inconsistencies.

3. Exploratory data analysis: conducted exploratory data analysis to identify trends, patterns, and correlations in the data.

4. Visualization: used various visualization techniques to present the results of our data analysis in a clear and concise manner.

## Machine Learning

The machine learning part of the project involves the following steps:

1. Feature selection: We selected the most relevant features from the datasets for use in our machine learning models.

2. Model selection: We experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests, to determine the best model for predicting climate change in Saudi Arabia.

3. Model training and evaluation: We trained and evaluated our machine learning models using the selected features and the cleaned datasets.

## Conclusion

This research project provides valuable insights into climate change in Saudi Arabia and demonstrates the potential of machine learning models for predicting future climate patterns. The code and findings of this project can be used by policymakers and environmental organizations to inform climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies in Saudi Arabia.
